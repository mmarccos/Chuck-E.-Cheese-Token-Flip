# Chuck-E.-Cheese-Token-Flip
Quick project made for fun during school. 

Have you ever wanted to settle something with a coinflip?
But didn't want to use a coin, but instead a Chuck E. Cheese Token?
Well you are in luck because you came to the right place.
With this simple app you can settle anything involving a coinflip,
but instead you are using a Chuck E. Cheese Token. You press "Flip Token"
and then either heads or tails will appear. Click "Reset" to reflip.
